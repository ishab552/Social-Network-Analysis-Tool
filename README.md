# Social-Network-Analysis-Tool
 Graph-based Social Network Analysis Tool - This project involves building and analyzing a simple social network graph, where users can be represented as nodes and friendships as edges.  Project: Social Network Analysis Tool  Features to Implement: 1. *Add a User*: Add a new user to the network. 2. *Add a Friendship*: Create a friendship (edge) between two users (nodes). 3. *Remove a User*: Remove a user and all associated friendships. 4. *Remove a Friendship*: Remove a specific friendship between two users. 5. *Display Network*: Print the current state of the network. 6. *Find Shortest Path*: Find the shortest path between two users using BFS. 7. *Connected Components*: Find all connected components in the network using DFS. 8. *Friend Recommendations*: Recommend friends based on mutual connections.  Steps to Implement:  1. *Define the Graph Class*:    - Attributes: An adjacency list to store the graph (e.g., std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>).    - Methods:      - addUser()      - addFriendship()      - removeUser()      - removeFriendship()      - displayNetwork()      - findShortestPath()      - connectedComponents()      - recommendFriends()  2. *Implement BFS for Shortest Path*:    - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.    - Track visited nodes and their distances from the start node.  3. *Implement DFS for Connected Components*:    - Use a stack or recursion to explore all nodes in a component.    - Track visited nodes to avoid reprocessing.  4. *Main Function*:    - Provide a menu to the user to select various options.    - Call the corresponding methods from the Graph class based on user input.
